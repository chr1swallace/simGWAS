\title{Simulate a dataset}
\usage{
make_dataset(df, N0, N1, CV, PWgY0, PWgY1)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{control dataset of genotypes to sample from, without
phenotype}

\item{N0}{number of samples with Y=0}

\item{N1}{number of samples with Y=1}

\item{CV}{which SNPs are causal?}

\item{PWgY0}{the distribution of causal snps in controls}

\item{PWgY1}{the distribution of causal snps in cases}
}
\value{
simulated genotype data for N0 controls and N1 cases
}
\description{
Simulate a dataset
}
\details{
Simulates a dataset given a set of controls (without
phenotype) and a causal model.  This is used for testing code.
